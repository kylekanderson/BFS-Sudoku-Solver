# BFS-Sudoku-Solver

Final project for my Master's Data Structures and Algorithms course.

Purpose of the assignment was to build an application that uses various sorts of data structures and algorithms to solve a problem. In this application, I'm using linked Node structures and breadth-first-searching to solve sudoku puzzle boards.
